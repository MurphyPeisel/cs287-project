# U.S. Migration
Here's the repo for our project! I have a file *287_project_murphy.ipynb* which contains the code that I'm working on. I figure it's best, for now, if we work in separate files so we don't have to deal with merge conflicts. If you want to put some of the code that is in my file into yours, the best way to do this is probably just to copy paste the cells that you want into your file. The easiest way to use GitHub is probably to just use the desktop app.
